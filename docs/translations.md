# Translations

User-facing strings are written in English and shipped through the text domain `sf-icon-manager`. Translation files live in `languages/`:

- `sf-icon-manager.pot` — source template
- `sf-icon-manager-*.po` / `.mo` — per-locale translations for the settings page and the block metadata
- `sf-icon-manager-<locale>-<hash>.json` — Jed-style JSON for the block editor script strings

`de_DE` is bundled. The plugin header sets `Text Domain: sf-icon-manager` and `Domain Path: /languages`; `load_plugin_textdomain()` is additionally hooked on `init` in `sf-icon-manager.php`. The `Domain Path` header is required for the just-in-time translation loading WordPress uses since 6.7 (it tells the `WP_Textdomain_Registry` where the bundled `.mo` files live before the first translation lookup).

## Adding or updating a locale

The POT includes the compiled editor bundle, so rebuild the block and extract first:

```bash
pnpm run build

# via WP-CLI (i18n command), from the plugin root:
wp i18n make-pot . languages/sf-icon-manager.pot --slug=sf-icon-manager --ignore-domain \
    --exclude="node_modules/**,vendor/**,tests/**,.github/**,languages/**" \
    --include="src/**,sf-icon-manager.php,build/block/index.js"

# fill in languages/sf-icon-manager-<locale>.po (German: sf-icon-manager-de_DE.po), then:
wp i18n make-mo languages
wp i18n make-json languages/sf-icon-manager-<locale>.po languages --pretty-print
```

`wp i18n make-json` **rewrites the source `.po`**: it extracts the strings that only occur in the editor script (`build/block/index.js`) into the `.json` and removes them from the `.po` (72 → 60 entries). Keep the committed `.po` complete by restoring those `build/block/index.js:1` entries from git after running `make-json`:

```bash
git checkout -- languages/sf-icon-manager-<locale>.po
```

(Only undo the PO rewrite; keep the generated `.json` and the freshly compiled `.mo`.)

Commit the generated `.pot`, `.po`, `.mo` and `.json` files.

## Notes

- WP-CLI `make-pot` scans `.php` and `.js`, but **not** `.tsx` — the block editor strings are extracted from the compiled `build/block/index.js`, so run `pnpm run build` before extracting.
- The block title/description (block.json) are translated at runtime through the plugin `.mo`; the JSON files only translate the editor script strings.
- A `.mo` that is bundled in the plugin's `languages/` folder is only picked up if the plugin header contains `Domain Path: /languages`. Without it, WordPress registers the plugin root as the language directory and the `.mo` is never found (WP 6.7+ registry fallback keeps the wrong cached path).
