# SVG Forge Icon Manager

Gutenberg plugin that inserts SVG icons from a central SVG sprite file (`ico.svg`) via `<use>` and links them. The sprite file can be uploaded directly from a settings page as an SVG fragment library or [theme override](#override-with-a-filter-recommended-git-versionable).

**This plugin is only useful for advanced theme and plugin developers who manage their own SVG sprite file.** It is not an SVG Forge Icon Manager manager: there is no UI to collect, organize or import individual icons — every icon must first exist as a `<symbol>` in a sprite file you own, build and version. The editor's symbol picker (see screenshot) then lets you select icons from that sprite simply by clicking and browsing.

## WordPress 7.1 already has SVG icons — why this plugin?

Since WordPress 7.1, core ships its own icon system: `wp_register_icon_collection()` / `wp_register_icon()` register icons once and they appear in the core Icon block picker, the REST API and the `wp_get_icon()` rendering helper. If you only need a few icons and they're single color, register them in your theme/plugin and **use core instead of this plugin**.

The fragment approach of this plugin still has advantages when you run a real sprite pipeline:

- **Full SVG survives.** The browser loads the `<symbol>` from the sprite and renders it via `<use>` unmodified — stroke-based icons, gradients, `currentColor`, inline styles and custom `viewBox` values all work. WordPress 7.1's sanitizer is intentionally strict (`<svg>/<path>/<polygon>` only, no `stroke`, no inline styles) and breaks most stroke-based icon sets.
- **Reuse existing assets.** Upload a sprite you already have (or generate one with a CLI tool like [svgforge-cli](https://github.com/svgforge/svgforge-cli/) — no per-icon PHP code required).
- **Need a sprite?** Learn step by step how to build your own custom SVG icon set in the tutorial: [Creating custom icon sets with svgforge-cli](https://svgforge.github.io/blog/posts/custom-icon-sets/).
- **Icon Groups.** Icons can be grouped, so you can find the icon you need much easier.
- **One file.** The sprite is a single cacheable file that can live in your theme repo and is versioned with Git.
- **Cache friendly.** The sprite is one static SVG file, so the browser caches it once and every icon on the whole site reuses that cached file — no per-icon HTTP requests.
- **Per-block control.** Fill *and* stroke colours, size (standard Dimensions panel with preset slider + custom input), links with `rel` handling and aria-labels — per instance, without touching a stylesheet.
- **Works on WordPress < 7.1.** The plugin supports 6.6+, so it works where the native API does not exist yet.

Honest limitations:

- To add or edit icons you must rebuild the sprite file — typically with a CLI tool such as [svgforge](https://github.com/svgforge/svgforge/) (there is no in-browser icon editor, and no code-free icon management UI).
- Icons live in your content as a block. The frontend markup is server-rendered (`render.php`), but there is no simple `wp_get_icon()`-style helper for theme PHP — for that, use the native 7.1 API.

## Features

- Settings page (Settings → SVG Forge Icon Manager) for uploading the SVG sprite file, including sanitization of scripts and event handlers
- Symbol picker in the editor with a live preview of all `<symbol>` elements from the sprite
- Icons can be linked (new tab with `noopener`/`noreferrer`)
- Aria-label for screen readers
- Fill/stroke colours and size per block (square, preset slider + custom input with units)
- Dynamic frontend rendering via `render.php` using `get_block_wrapper_attributes()`
- Block supports: alignment, anchor, additional CSS classes

## Requirements

- WordPress >= 6.6
- PHP >= 8.3

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` (or install the ZIP from a GitHub release)
2. Activate the plugin
3. Under **Settings → SVG Forge Icon Manager**, upload the `ico.svg` file containing `<symbol id="my-icon" viewBox="0 0 24 24">…</symbol>` elements (or configure another source, see below)
4. In the editor, add the "SVG Icon" block and choose an icon

Composer users should read [Composer installation](docs/composer-installation.md).

## Sprite file configuration

### Generating a sprite with svgforge-cli

Install [svgforge-cli](https://github.com/svgforge/svgforge-cli/) and build a valid `ico.svg` sprite (with `<symbol id="…" viewBox="…">` elements) from a folder of SVG icons:

```bash
npm install --global @svgforge/svgforge-cli
svgforge --symbol --dest=out 'assets/./**/*.svg'
```

svgforge-cli sanitizes the SVG (stripping scripts, event handlers and `javascript:` links) and optimizes the output with svgo. The `./` keeps the relative paths, so files in subdirectories become `directory--filename` IDs — each directory is then a filter group in the icon picker. The generated sprite can be uploaded via the settings page or referenced from the theme via the `sfim_sprite_url` filter, see below.

The SVG sprite file is resolved in this order (the first existing source wins):

1. **Filter `sfim_sprite_url`** – the canonical override (theme file, CDN). **Has priority.**
2. **Upload from settings** – file uploaded via the settings page.
3. **Fallback `sprite.svg`** bundled with the plugin (`wp-content/plugins/sf-icon-manager/sprite.svg`).

### Override with a filter (recommended, Git-versionable)

In your theme's `functions.php`, return the URL of your own sprite file — the file then lives in the theme repo and is versioned with the theme:

```php
add_filter( 'sfim_sprite_url', fn () => get_theme_file_uri( 'assets/ico.svg' ) );
```

or point it at a CDN:

```php
add_filter( 'sfim_sprite_url', fn () => 'https://cdn.example.com/icons/ico.svg' );
```

The filter is the only supported override mechanism and wins over everything, including a backend upload.

## WordPress 7.1 native icon integration (experimental)

On WordPress >= 7.1 the plugin can register every `<symbol>` of the configured sprite as an `sf-icon-manager` collection via `wp_register_icon()`. The same sprite then also powers the **core Icon block** and `wp_get_icon()`, in addition to the SVG Icon block.

> **Experimental:** this integration relies on the brand-new WordPress 7.1 icon API and core's strict sanitizer. The behavior may change as that API evolves; treat it as opt-in and test carefully.

The integration is controlled on the settings page ("WordPress native icon integration", default **Off**):

- **Off**: nothing is registered natively (the fragment block works as before).
- **On**: the sprite's symbols are registered as core Icon block icons. Registration is lazy — it only runs when the REST icon endpoints are called or a core Icon block renders, so plain page loads stay free of registration work regardless of the icon count.
- **Off + disable the core Icon block**: same as Off, plus `core/icon` is truly deregistered — server-side (`unregister_block_type()`, it no longer appears in the block editor settings or the block-types REST API) and in the block editor itself (`wp.blocks.unregisterBlockType()`), so the block also stops working for instances already saved in content.

Caveat: core's conservative sanitizer strips `stroke` and inline styles, so stroke-based sprite icons degrade to their fill shapes when consumed through the native path. The fragment block remains the primary experience; the core integration is a companion, not a replacement.

**Performance:** none of the three modes slows down plain page loads. `off` (the default) does no native work at all, and `on` registers lazily — only when a REST icon endpoint is hit or a core Icon block renders — cached and idempotent per request. `no_block` only adds cheap registry guards. A frontend page that uses neither the core Icon block nor the REST icon routes never parses the sprite for the native path.

## Block settings in theme.json

Colors follow the standard Gutenberg block color controls (`supports.color`, like the core Icon block): the icon is rendered with `fill: currentColor`, so the **Color** panel ("Text" – the icon color) recolors monochrome icons. Like the core Icon block, both **Color** and **Background** are applied to the SVG element itself, not to the block row. To disable the Color/Background panels for the block entirely, set it in your theme:

```json
{
	"version": 3,
	"settings": {
		"blocks": {
			"sf-icon-manager/svg-icon": {
				"color": { "custom": false, "palette": [] }
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Multi-color sprite icons (e.g. Tango icon sets) keep their baked-in colors — recoloring has no visible effect on them, exactly like the core Icon block. Monochrome icons (fill `currentColor` / no fixed fill) follow the chosen color.

The **Size** is the standard Gutenberg Dimensions panel (`supports.dimensions.width`, like the core Icon block): the block is square, and size presets come from the theme via the standard `dimensions.dimensionSizes` per block:

```json
{
	"version": 3,
	"settings": {
		"blocks": {
			"sf-icon-manager/svg-icon": {
				"dimensions": {
					"dimensionSizes": [
						{ "name": "S", "slug": "s", "size": "32px" },
						{ "name": "L", "slug": "l", "size": "64px" }
					],
					"width": true
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

With presets the panel shows a slider that moves across the preset sizes (like the core Icon block). A toggle next to it switches to a custom value input with a slider, using the allowed units (`spacing.units`). `setting.dimensions.width: false` disables sizing entirely, so the block always renders at its default size.
